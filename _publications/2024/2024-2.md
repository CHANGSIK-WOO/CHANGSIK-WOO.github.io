  To detect Mura defect automatically, PaDiM, that is a type of Anomaly Detection, was tested. <br>
  1. [Feasibility Test] at now, Mura defect is currently only detected under manual inspection. But in previous process, there is process of making screen images by camera. By using these images, test involved Image Download, Image Processing, Training & Modeling, and Performance Verification. It is concluded that PaDiM will be good solution for automating to detect. <br>
  2. [Optimizing Image Processing] When taking an image in the previous process, images may be rotated or curved due to many reasons. If these images are cut into same size and pattern without image processing, not only miss-detect will occur in the cut location, but also over-detect will occur due to Black data. To improve this problem, a Python module for image processing was developed. that module find edges through contour approximation, and rotation and curve are improved through perceptual transform. In conclusion, PaDiM Accuracy is improved. (OK Accuracy : 11% → 69% / NG Accuracy : 29% → 93%)
