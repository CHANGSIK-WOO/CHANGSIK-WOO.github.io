abstract: >-
The feasibility test of automating mura defect detection, which was previously conducted through manual inspection, was conducted by using PaDiM, an anomaly detection method.

[Feasibility Test]
The process involved acquiring images, preprocessing, model training/modeling, and evaluation, all implemented using Python-based code. Through iterative evaluations, conditions suitable for automated inspection were identified.

[Optimization of Preprocessing Methods]
In the initial image processing approach, over-detection and under-detection occurred due to inconsistencies in cropping, resulting in lower detection accuracy. This issue was addressed by extracting edges through contour approximation and applying perspective transformation. Additionally, variations in brightness between images, which could lead to over-detection or under-detection, were mitigated through normalization, further enhancing detection accuracy.
